This test case is similar to the one before it but it actually demonstrates a security (availability) bug here. This test case demonstrates that when we attempt to do something as principal which has yet to be created their server returns status code DENIED back to the client while the oracle returns status code FAILED. This is an important difference because their server is suggested there was a security violation when really we actually were giving them a malformed program which should have resulted in failure.
